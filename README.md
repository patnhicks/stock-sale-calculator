# üìà Stock Sale Capital Gains Calculator

This Python script calculates the capital gains tax and net profit (or loss) from selling shares of stock across **two separate sales**. It guides the user through the process of entering sale details, validates input against available shares, and outputs a summary of gains, tax, and final profit.

## üõ† How It Works

The script assumes:
- You initially own **200 shares**
- Shares were purchased at **$30 per share**
- Capital gains tax rate is **15%**

You will be prompted to:
1. Enter how many shares to sell in the first sale
2. Enter the sale price per share
3. Enter how many of the remaining shares to sell in a second sale
4. Enter the second sale price per share

The script then outputs:
- Total cost basis
- Total received from sales
- Capital gains tax owed
- Final net profit
